# A STPA-Guided SOTIF Assessment of Real-Time Autonomous Driving Behavior in Uncertain Environments

This repository presents a new SOTIF(Safety Of The Intended Functionality) assessment tool for ADS----SOTIFA. It can systematically evaluate the SOTIF risk of different design models of ADS(Automated Driving System) under an uncertain environment.

## Overview


- The method systematically evaluates the safety of autonomous vehicles in open and uncertain environments, quantifying the ADS **SOTIF risk**.To enhance SOTIF evaluation adaptability, we extend the property set **"EnvAADL"**, which captures hybrid external dynamic environments. Engineers can use EnvAADL (Environmental Architecture Analysis and Design Language) to develop and understand ADS efficiently, supplement key information in existing AADL models, and reuse them for assessment. To address the huge state space caused by continuous behaviors and uncertain environments, we provide efficient ERV (EUCA Risk Value) mechanisms as a reference value for quantification, enabling **SOTIFA** to perform end-to-end SOTIF assessment based on STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis).


## Installation:

We conducted the experiment using the tool chain under the following environments. We hope it can work under other operating systems and tool versions as well.

- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04.2
- Pre-installed software:
  - [java 17.0.8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
  - [osate2-2.11.0](https://osate-build.sei.cmu.edu/download/osate/stable/2.11.0/products/)
  - [Neo4j 5.10.0(COMMUNITY)](https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/#releases)

SOTIFA uses the environment above. After installing the tools, we also need to import the information we need:

- **Copy lib to /usr/lib**

```
sudo cp -r lib/* /usr/lib/
```

- **Import the Knowledge Graph**

Navigate to the 'bin' directory within the installation directory of Neo4j.
```
./neo4j-admin database load --from-path=/home/cxy/SOTIFATools neo4j --overwrite-destination=true
neo4j start
```
- Replace `/path/to/neo4j` with the actual Neo4j path.
- Set USER as `neo4j`, PASSWORD as `12345678`.

- **Install the EnvAADL plugin on OSATE2**

```

## Running SOTIFA:


This guide provides an overview of how to use SOTIFA for assessing SOTIF risks in autonomous driving systems (ADS). Ensure all dependencies are installed before proceeding.


#### 1. üìê EnvAADL Modeling

Import the `env-self-driving-car/` project or create your own.

- The system consists of hybrid automata extracted from plant, controller, and environment components.

<img src="README.source/top+plant.jpg" alt="top+plant" width="600px" />
<img src="README.source/tcontroller+env.jpg" alt="tcontroller+env" width="600px" />

##### üîß Main Components

- **Plant Component**  
  Models the ego car‚Äôs dynamics with initial values (like `x_ego = 0`, `v_ego = 10`, `a_ego = 0`).

- **Environment Component**  
  Defines external factors (e.g., friction, slope) and dynamic actors (e.g., environmental vehicles).

- **Controller Component**  
  Samples ego car and environmental parameters, then calculates acceleration to maintain a safe distance from the preceding vehicle.

> **Note:** ***perception modeling***. Crucially, this component also formalizes how variable atmospheric conditions, such as weather and visibility, impact the perception system. To achieve this, the component interfaces with a knowledge graph that maps specific conditions (e.g., ‚Äòvisibility<50') to quantifiable perception error magnitudes. This allows the framework to dynamically generate a realistic perception_error value, which is then used by the vehicle's control model to simulate how real-world environmental effects can lead to potential SOTIF-related risks.

#### 2. üìâ SOTIF Assessment

Run the assessment:

- Click `SOTIFA` ‚Üí `SOTIF assessment under uncertain environment` to analyze risks.

<img src="README.source/tool interface.jpg" alt="interface" width="600px" />

The middle panel displays the EnvAADL model code for the ADS in the illustrated case (Sec. II-B). The assessment process begins with `SOTIFA` performing static checks to ensure EnvAADL syntax compliance. Users initiate the assessment by selecting `SOTIFA` ‚Üí `SOTIF assessment under uncertain environment` at the top, prompting the tool to parse the `EnvAADL` file and update the right panel with the hazard analysis tree and the SOTIF risk score (Sec. VI). Upon running the assessment, an `EnvAADLAnalysis` folder is generated on the left, containing intermediate analysis files, including automata files extracted from `EnvAADL` (Sec. IV-B), EUCAs-based specification files (Sec. V), and final analysis results in the `analysisResults` folder, which contains the hazard analysis tree annotated with scores (Sec. VI).

### üß† Knowledge Graph Construction

We construct a knowledge graph to formalize causal links from traffic losses to unsafe actions:

#### Construction Process: Step-by-Step Methodology

The Knowledge Graph (KG) serves as a reusable knowledge base for SOTIF analysis, capturing causal relationships from environmental conditions to system actions, unsafe constraints, hazards, and potential losses. Its construction follows a systematic, top-down causal reasoning process, grounded in traffic accident reports and scenario modeling standards such as ASAM OpenSCENARIO.

The construction steps are:

1. **Identify Potential Loss**  
   Start from a high-level `Loss` node, such as *‚ÄúLoss of life or personal injury.‚Äù*

2. **Decompose into Causal Hazards**  
   Identify system-level hazards that could lead to this loss. For example, the `Hazard` node *‚Äúvehicle exceeding the speed limit‚Äù* is linked to the `Loss` node via a `Caused_by` edge.

3. **Formalize Hazards as Constraints**  
   Translate each hazard into a machine-readable `UnsafeSystemConstraint` node. For instance, the hazard above becomes the formal constraint `v_ego > vmax`.

4. **Link Triggering Actions and Environmental Factors**  
   Identify `Action` nodes (e.g., *‚Äúcontinuous acceleration‚Äù*) that can trigger the unsafe constraint. Parameters involved (e.g., `vmax`, modeled as `EnvFactorParam`) are influenced by environmental conditions represented by `EnvFactor` nodes (e.g., *‚ÄúVisibility < 50‚Äù*). This links the unsafe system constraint, the triggering action, and relevant environmental factors in a structured, machine-readable representation.

---

#### Example: Hazard-to-KG Mapping

Consider the scenario of a vehicle speeding under low visibility. The KG nodes and relations include:

- **Loss Node**  
  - `Loss_ID`: "L-1"  
  - `Description`: "Loss of life or personal injury"

- **Hazard Node**  
  - `Hazard_ID`: "H-1"  
  - `Description`: "Vehicle exceeding the speed limit"  
  - Connected to the `Loss` node via `Caused_by` edge

- **UnsafeSystemConstraint Node**  
  - `Description`: "v_ego > vmax"  
  - Connected to the `Hazard` node via `Caused_by` edge

- **Action Node**  
  - "Acceleration"  
  - Linked to the `UnsafeSystemConstraint` node by `Caused_by` edge, with property `types_of_providing = provide`

- **EnvFactor Node**  
  - "Visibility < 50"  
  - Captures environmental conditions affecting system parameters

- **EnvFactorParam Node**  
  - `Expression`: "vmax"  
  - `Value`: 20 km/h  
  - `Result`: "minimum"  
  - Ensures that under multiple environmental factors, the strictest safe bound is applied

This example shows how a real-world hazard is decomposed into nodes and edges, producing a causal subgraph that connects losses, hazards, unsafe constraints, actions, and environmental factors.

#### Tooling, Semi-Automation, and Reproducibility

- The KG is currently **manually constructed**, but efficiency is enhanced using reusable **constraint templates** and **causal patterns**, allowing domain experts to semi-automatically expand the KG for new scenarios.  
- Future work aims to develop tools that automatically instantiate these templates from formal ADS specifications, further reducing manual effort.  

- The **entire KG dataset** and the **associated `SOTIFA` plugin** are publicly available, enabling replication of the KG construction, SOTIF risk assessment, and extension of the framework.  
- The KG is stored in **Neo4j**, a graph database whose Cypher query language enables traversal and automated reasoning.


### üåç Environmental Factors

**SOTIFA** considers a broad range of environmental factors, including: **road characteristics** (e.g., type, slope, friction), **atmospheric conditions** (e.g., weather, visibility), and **infrastructure elements** (e.g., traffic lights, rail crossings, parking restrictions, and restricted U-turn areas), as well as both dynamic and static actors involved in the scenario.

Constraints such as *traffic light restrictions*, *rail crossing areas*, *parking restrictions*, and *restricted U-turn areas* are primarily represented based on their **spatial extent**. Each is defined as a bounded rectangular region using coordinate parameters (e.g., `parking_restrictionX_env` and `parking_restrictionY_env`), which allows for distance-based constraint representation. In addition to spatial boundaries, dynamic infrastructure states‚Äîsuch as the state of a traffic light‚Äîare modeled through variables like `signal`, which encode whether a condition permits passage or not.

Rather than assigning fixed values or simply sampling from a uniform range, SOTIFA uses dynamic expressions such as `slope = [0.4, 0.6]` to indicate the **search bounds for a dynamic input signal**, $slope(t)$. These predefined bounds are passed into the falsification engine, which searches for critical trajectories likely to trigger unsafe control actions.

To enable such trajectory-level analysis, each input signal is parameterized as a piecewise continuous function. The **granularity** of the analysis is directly determined by the number of user-defined interpolation segments (e.g., 3 or 5), which control the signal's complexity. This mechanism enables the falsifier to explore a richer and more nuanced dynamic input space, as opposed to simplistic random sampling strategies.

The implementation relies on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) [Gough, 2009], allowing efficient numerical computation and optimization. This integration empowers SOTIFA to conduct a more thorough analysis of environmental uncertainty, contributing to more robust SOTIF risk identification.

### üìä Statistical Significance and Sensitivity Analysis

We conducted 15 independent runs per configuration (TB1‚ÄìTB4, IDM1‚ÄìIDM4, OVM1‚ÄìOVM4) to assess risk. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests show significant differences (p < 0.05) across all model pairs. Bootstrap analysis provides mean risk scores and 95% confidence intervals.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Sensitivity of SOTIFA Formula

Three parameters involved in  **EUCA Risk Value (ERV)** 
Here, the parameters are defined as:

- `k‚ÇÅ = 1.57` (approximation of œÄ/2 for tangent)
- `k‚ÇÇ = 1.5`
- `k‚ÇÉ = 10`

We apply ¬±20% variation to test the robustness of the formula across four ADS configurations (TB1‚ÄìTB4).

##### üî¨ Sensitivity Results

| **k‚ÇÅ** | **k‚ÇÇ** | **k‚ÇÉ** | **TB1**   | **TB2**   | **TB3**   | **TB4**   |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1.57   | 1.5    | 10     | 0.679635  | 0.382802  | 0.697054  | 0.518920  |
| 1.30   | 1.5    | 10     | 0.682470  | 0.384439  | 0.702480  | 0.526112  |
| 1.57   | 1.3    | 10     | 0.677391  | 0.379611  | 0.696454  | 0.516535  |
| 1.57   | 1.5    | 8      | 0.675791  | 0.376590  | 0.691530  | 0.513414  |
| 1.57   | 1.7    | 12     | 0.680553  | 0.385474  | 0.699097  | 0.520160  |

The SOTIFA scores remain stable under moderate parameter changes, showing robustness in identifying high-risk ADS configurations.

### üîí Probabilistic Guarantees

Our choice of falsification stems from the inherent undecidability of verifying complex hybrid systems that combine continuous dynamics with discrete logic. Instead, we focus on falsification-guided testing as a scalable and practical approach to finding safety violations. While falsification-based evaluation by its nature cannot guarantee completeness, our approach proposes the ***EUCA Risk Value (ERV)*** to provide a reference value for the SOTIF-related risk based on the falsification process.

Although the ERV does not provide formal guarantees of completeness, our method's underlying falsification is built upon a well-established theoretical foundation in classification-based derivative-free optimization, as described by [Yu et al., 2016]. This foundation provides probabilistic guarantees on its ability to approximate the global optimum within a bounded number of queries.

Specifically, given an objective function \(f\), if a classification-based optimization algorithm has failure probability \(\delta > 0\) and approximation level \(\epsilon \geq 0\), the query complexity (i.e., the number of solution samples) is upper bounded by:

$$
\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{|D_\epsilon|} \left((1 - \lambda) + \frac{\lambda}{\gamma T} \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1 - \frac{R_t}{1 - \lambda} - \theta}{|D_t|} \right)^{-1} \ln \frac{1}{\delta}\right)
$$

This implies that the probability of obtaining a solution satisfying \( |f(x) - f^{\text{opt}}| \leq \epsilon \) is at least \(1 - \delta\), i.e.,

$$
\mathbb{P}(| f(x) - f^{\text{opt}} | \leq \epsilon) \geq 1 - \delta 
$$

where:

- $f^{\text{opt}}$ is the minimum function value  
- $D_{\epsilon}$ is the area of the overall target solutions (i.e., solutions close to the global optimum within $\epsilon$)  
- $D_t$ is the area of the target solutions in iteration $t$ (i.e., the area that $\tilde{D}_t$ approximates)  
- $|\cdot|$ denotes the ratio of the area to the total search space  
- $R_t$ is the prediction error of $\tilde{D}_t$ with respect to $D_t$  
- $T$ is the total number of iterations


Importantly, while our system is not formally verified, this theoretical result ensures that, under reasonable conditions on the learning model (i.e., small $\theta$-dependence and $\gamma$-shrinkage), our sampling procedure is not arbitrary and will identify unsafe behaviors with high probability if they exist within the accessible search space. In practice, we have demonstrated this capability in ADS, exhibiting continuous behavior in a complex and uncertain environment.
